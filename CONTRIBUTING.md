# Steps...
1. Fork and Develop: Start by forking the TReq repository, and create a new branch for your contribution. Develop and make the changes in your branch.
2. Check Guidelines: Before submitting your contribution, ensure that it aligns with the project's guidelines. This includes coding standards, documentation conventions, and any other relevant guidelines. Run always `cargo fmt` to ensure the code is formatted.
3. Run Tests: If your contribution involves code changes or introduces new features, run the tests to ensure everything is working as expected.
```sh
cargo test
```

You'll need to run the E2E tests too, they need to be in a clear enviroment of TReq usage setup (like folders it creates for usage)
```sh
cargo test --features run_e2e_tests
```

Docker can be used to ensure a clean environment for E2E tests:
```sh
docker compose -f tests/compose.yml build run_e2e 
docker compose -f tests/compose.yml run --rm run_e2e
```
4. Submit a Pull Request: Once you are confident in your changes, submit a pull request. Provide a clear and detailed description of your contribution.
5. Wait for Feedback: After submitting your pull request, wait for feedback from maintainers. They may review your changes, provide suggestions, or request modifications.
